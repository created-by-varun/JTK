# Introduction

In this chapter, we introduce you to the framework and the licenses.

## What is Jez Toolkit (JTK)?
Jez Toolkit (JTK) is a framework designed for writing powerful applications
in C.

Initially, the development of the framework began within an other project, a
compiler for Zen. Zen is a programming language currently under development
at OneCube Software Solutions. We observed a need for a framework that could be
reused in other projects, too. Therefore, we refactored the reusable components
and called it Jez Toolkit (JTK).

As of this version, JTK is quite unstable. It lacks detailed documentation and
examples. We recommend you not to integrate it with your projects. We have
published the framework only for the sake of testing it.

## License

The Jez Toolkit (JTK) is dual-licensed under commercial and open source licenses.
The commercial license permits you to create and distribute software on your own
terms without any open source license obligations.

JTK is also available under GPLv2 open source license. The open source licensing
is ideal for open source projects, student/academic purposes, hobby projects,
internal research projects without external distribution, or other projects
where all GPLv2 obligations can be met.
