## What is Jez Tookit (JTK)?
Jez Tookit (JTK) is a framework designed for writing powerful applications
in C.

Initially, the development of the framework began within an other project, a
compiler for Zen. Zen is a programming language currently under development
at OneCube Software Solutions. We observed a need for a framework that could be
reused in other projects, too. Therefore, we refactored the reusable components
and called it Jez Toolkit (JTK).

As of this version, JTK is quite unstable. It lacks detailed documentation and
examples. We recommend you not to integrate it with your projects. We have
published the framework only for the sake of testing it.
